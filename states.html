    <h1>
        <b>1. <a href="https://www.alabama.gov/">Alabama</a></b>
    </h1>
    <p> Alabama's website was my favorite of the five for many reasons. The first reason is that it is eye catching and pleasing. The colors that were chosen are welcoming and not overwhelming. The second reason is how user friendly the site is. The search bar ws easy to access, the menus were easy to navigate, and the common searches would be very helpful in assisting me in what I might have be looking for whether I was a tourist or a citizen. The third reason is how fast and efficient the site is, when items were clicked on they loaded swiftly. Finally, this site was my favorite because even when it was shrunk down to a mobile size it stayed easy to navigate. Overall, Alabama's website was easy to navigate both on mobile and computer screens, the way it was set up was welcoming, eye pleasing, and made things simple to find. </p>

    <h2>
        <b>2.<a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm"> New Hampshire </a></b>
    </h2>
    <p> New Hampshire's website came in second but was very close to first. I enjoyed everything about their website. The colors were very welcoming and inviting. I also thought that the way everything was organized made it very easy to read and understand. The way things were organized into boxes made them easy to see and hard to miss. The common searches on the left side are very helpful for someone who is confused on what they are looking for. Overall, I think this website only came in second because Alabama's was just more inviting but other than that New Hampshire's had everything that makes up a user friendly website. </p>
    <h3>
        <b> 3. <a href="https://www.mass.gov/"> Massachusetts</a></b>
    </h3>
    <p> This website is my third favorite website because the only thing I did not like were the colors and setup of the website itself. The strange yellow-orange color at the top is very unwelcoming. Other than that the website has easy access tabs, it loads quickly, the menu was easy to navigate and it had tabs that were useful to both citizens and tourists. For example, information on covid-19 was located at the top and then right below that is information on living, working, and touring in Massachesetts. It also fits into a mobile screen well. Overall, this is a user friendly and useful website. </p>
    <h4>
        <b> 4. <a href="https://mn.gov/portal/">Minnesota</a></b>
    </h4>
    <p> I really enjoyed Minnesota's website. The search bar in the middle was very easy to access. The menu tabs and link thorughout the home page were common interest and would helpp both the citizen and the tourist. The colors on this website are very pleasing and relaxing. Overall, I really liked this site but it was nothing special.</p>
    <h5>
        <b> 5.<a href="https://alaska.gov/"> Alaska</a> </b>
    </h5>
    <p> Alaska's website was my least favorite site. First, when shrunk down to mobile, it no longer fit the screen and became almost impossible to navigate. Second, the colors were not as bright or as welcoming as I would have chosen. The pictures, however, were very pretty and showed the beauty of Alaska. Third, the menus that were presented on the home page were somewhat confusing and diffucult to understand. Overall, this website will get the job done, but it has some things that could be changed to make it even better. </p>
