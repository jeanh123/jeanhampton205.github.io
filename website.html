            <h1>PacSun </h1>
            <p>

                I chose PacSun as one of the better websites. PacSun is a shopping outlet that I often shop at. I choose to shop here because of their high-quality clothes and their user-friendly website. PacSun's code is very modern they used HTML5. I noticed img's, divs, and id's among many others. At the top they have a navigation bar that when you hover over drops down into a table of information. Something I really like about this website is that when I hover over an option on the navigation and then scroll down through the tables, the table stays and does not disappear when the cursor leaves the navigation bar. PacSun's overall website layout is very clear and concise. I have never had any trouble finding the products that I needed. The colors of PacSun's website are very calm. They are predominantly white and black with various pops of color. I think that keeping the colors simple and easy on the eyes helps the consumer easily navigate the website without getting overwhelmed. Something that I really enjoy about this website is how on the home page there are various pictures of people modeling the products. In the pictures, the people look happy and comfortable in their PacSun clothes. When I see these eye-catching photos, it makes me want to click on the links and hit 'add to cart' all day. I, also, like the cleanness of the website. How the unimportant things such as catch phrases or political views are in small text and important things such as sales are in large text. Overall, PacSun's website is a user friendly and sharp website that I enjoy very much.

                <h2>
                    Urbanoutfitters</h2>
                <p>Urbanoutfitters' website is very similar to Pacsun's. It is, also, a clothing store with added home goods such as bedding or rugs. Urbanoutfitters uses modern HTML5 elements. I saw a lot of id's, scripts, and many other HTML5 elements. Urbanoutfitters' website utilizes plenty of tables. They use tables in their navigation and section. Their colors are like PacSun's with the prominent colors being black and white. However, Urbanoutfitters uses many more pops of color and brightness throughout their website. Something that really sets Urbanoutfitter's website above of the rest is the little pictures all over the home screen that depict models wearing the stores clothing or using their other products. Underneath all these pictures are descriptions telling the potential buyer what they are looking at and if they are interested, they can simply click on the picture and it will take them to the products shown in the picture. Navigating this website is very simple. All the product categories are listed at the top of the website. Once one of these options are hovered over, the list of products appears below and are easy to click on. The menus are also very thorough which makes products very easy to locate. Urbanoutfitters' layout is very simple to navigate and easy to read. Overall, Urbanoutfitters' website is very sharp and clear making purchases and navigating simple.

                <h3> Kolar Tire</h3>

                <p> Kolar Tire is a locally owner and operated tire and auto shop. There are several aspects of this website that makes it the worst website that I have come across. The home page is a messy, chaotic display of pictures of tires trucks, and green and orange writing. There is a black background with what looks to be green tire treads. This chaotic home page only leads to overwhelmed customers. The hover aspects on the navigation bar are incredibly unprofessional and cheap looking. I investigated the code behind the website, and it did use HTML5. However, the website was simple and could definitely use some helpful upgrades. The colors on this website are prominently black, green, and orange. There are hints of silver as well. The colors themselves are not poor choices but put them all together and it creates a very stressful on the eyes, website. Another negative aspect of this website is that it does not list the prices. When a customer goes to put an item into their cart, they must call the owner to determine the price. This is an incredible annoyance and can cause the buying process to slow immensely. Navigating this website was very difficult. Between the crazy colors and unprofessional navigation bars, the website is very difficult to understand. Websites like this can cause potential customers to go to an alternative website, one that is more easily understood. </p>
