                <h1> Our Story</h1>
                <p> Shenanigans was built off the desire to offer the younger generation of Helena a place to go to make memories and gather with friends. Shenanigans is a bar that offers something special compared to the
                    competitors already in the market.</p>
                <p>Helena has its bars, but these bars are catered to everyone. I
                    want to offer a bar that is specifically catered to ages 21-30. I want this to be a space that young
                    adults can feel welcomed and comfortable spending their time and money.</p>
                <p>Shenanigans is
                    themed after popular irish pubs located in the most popular cities of Ireland. My vision for Shenanigans is to have
                    special theme nights, drink specials, karaoke nights, and open mic nights. There
                    would also be live music on certain nights and Shenanigans would serve food as well as
                    drinks. I want to create a space that is safe and fun. My mission is to create an atmosphere that
                    exceeds that of what Helena has to offer young adults.</p>
